Working of Heartbeat Monitor Project
Working of this project is quite easy but a little calculation for calculating heart rate is required. There are several methods for calculating heart rate, but here we have read only five pulses. Then we have calculated total heart beat in a minute by applying the below formula:

     Five_pusle_time=time2-time1;

      Single_pulse_time= Five_pusle_time /5;

      rate=60000/ Single_pulse_time;

where time1 is first pulse counter value

time2 is list pulse counter value

rate is final heart rate.


When first pulse comes, we start counter by using timer counter function in arduino that is millis();. And take first pulse counter value form millis();. Then we wait for five pulses. After getting five pulses we again take counter value in time2 and then we substarct time1 from time2 to take original time taken by five pulses. And then divide this time by 5 times for getting single pulse time. Now we have time for single pulse and we can easily find the pulse in one minute, deviding 600000 ms by single pulse time.

Rate= 600000/single pulse time.

In this project we have used Heart beat sensor module to detect Heart Beat. This sensor module contains an IR pair which actually detect heart beat from blood. Heart pumps the blood in body which is called heart beat, when it happens the blood concentration in body changes. And we use this change to make a voltage or pulse electrically.
